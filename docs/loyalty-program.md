# Loyalty Program System

## Overview

The Barbaros Barbershop loyalty program is a comprehensive visit-based reward system that encourages client retention through milestone-based incentives. The system tracks client visits and allows them to work towards specific rewards they select.

## Core Principles

### Simple & Clean Design

- **Client-controlled goal setting** - Clients choose which reward they want to work towards

- **Progress visualization** - Clear progress tracking for both clients and staff

### Key Features

1. **Visit Counting System** - Automatic tracking of client visits
2. **Reward Selection** - Clients can choose their reward goals
3. **Progress Tracking** - Visual progress bars and milestone indicators
4. **Barber Redemption** - Staff-controlled reward redemption process
5. **Comprehensive Analytics** - Detailed statistics for business insights

## System Architecture

### Database Models

#### Client Model Extensions
```typescript
interface IClient {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Loyalty Program Fields
  selectedReward?: string; // ID of the reward they're working towards
  selectedRewardStartVisits?: number; // Visit count when they selected this reward
  totalLifetimeVisits: number; // Total visits ever (doesn't reset)
  currentProgressVisits: number; // Visits since last reward redemption
  nextRewardEligibleAt?: number; // Visit count when next reward will be eligible
  loyaltyStatus: 'new' | 'active' | 'milestone_reached' | 'inactive';
  loyaltyJoinDate?: Date;
}
```

#### Reward Model

## Business Logic

### Visit Counting Logic

#### Scenario Handling
The system intelligently handles various scenarios:

**Example: Client with 10 visits selects a 6-visit reward**
1. Client has 10 total lifetime visits
2. Selects reward requiring 6 visits
3. Can redeem immediately (10 ≥ 6)
4. After redemption: currentProgressVisits resets to 4 (10 - 6 = 4)
5. Progress towards next reward starts from 4 visits

#### Visit Recording Flow
```
Visit Created → Loyalty Progress Updated → Milestone Check → Status Update
```

1. **Visit Creation** - New visit recorded in system
2. **Counter Updates** - Both lifetime and progress counters increment
3. **Milestone Check** - System checks if any rewards are now available
4. **Status Update** - Client status updated to 'milestone_reached' if applicable
5. **Notification** - Client and staff notified of new milestones

### Reward Eligibility Logic

#### Eligibility Criteria
- **Visit Count** - Client must have enough visits for the reward
- **Reward Status** - Reward must be active
- **Usage Limits** - Respect maxRedemptions per client
- **Expiration** - Check validForDays if applicable

#### Edge Cases Handled
- **Multiple Eligible Rewards** - Client can choose from any eligible options
- **Reward Deactivation** - Handle rewards that become inactive after selection
- **Visit Count Adjustments** - Manual admin adjustments properly update eligibility
- **Data Consistency** - Automatic validation and correction of inconsistent states
