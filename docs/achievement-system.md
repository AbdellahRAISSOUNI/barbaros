  subcategory?: string;
  requirement: number;

}
```

### Progress Calculation Examples

// Automatically updates daily, tracks milestones like 30, 90, 180, 365 days
```

#### Consistency Streaks
```typescript
// Track consecutive days with minimum service count
for (let i = 0; i < daysToCheck; i++) {
  const dayVisits = await Visit.countDocuments({
    barberId: barberId,
    visitDate: { $gte: dayStart, $lt: dayEnd }
  });
  
  if (dayVisits >= minimumRequired) {
    currentStreak++;
  } else {
    break; // Streak broken
  }
}
```

#### Quality Metrics
