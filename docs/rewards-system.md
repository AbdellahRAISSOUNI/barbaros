2. Visit recording integration for immediate use
3. Client-facing features for transparency

## Conclusion

The rewards system implementation provides a complete, production-ready loyalty program for the Barbaros Barbershop application. It includes all requested CRUD operations, administrative controls, and seamless integration with the existing visit recording system. The system is designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and extensible for future enhancements.
